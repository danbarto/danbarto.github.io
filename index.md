# About me

I'm a particle physicist currently working at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu).
I work with the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern) at the [CERN](https://home.cern) Large Hadron Collider.
My github username is inspired by Bart Simpson's alter-ego *El Barto*.

I like riding my bike around Boston, reading books and listening to good music (just rediscovered the amazing [hype machine](https://hypem.com/DanBarto)).
I still have a regular news paper subscription.

## Research interests

My research is currently focussed on understanding the coupling of top quarks to the [SM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) [gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons).
You can find results of my previous work [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11270), and projections for future results in [this document](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04070).
I also work on the development of a new part of the CMS detector [that can measure the arrival time of particles with a below 50ps time resolution.](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2667167)

During my [PhD thesis](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/2667) I focussed on searches for [supersymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry) particles like [gluinos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09814) or [top squarks]().
