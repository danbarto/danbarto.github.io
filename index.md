# About me

I'm a particle physicist currently working at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu).
I work with the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern) at the [CERN](https://home.cern) Large Hadron Collider.
My github username is inspired by Bart Simpson`s alter-ego *El Barto*.

## Research interests

My research is currently focussed on understanding the coupling of top quarks to the SM gauge bosons.
You can find results of my previous work [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11270), and projections for future results in [this document](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04070).
I also work on the devolpment of a new part of the CMS detector [that can measure the arrival time of particles with a below 50ns time resolution.](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2667167)
