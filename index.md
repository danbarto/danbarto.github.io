# About me

I'm a particle physicist currently working at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu).
I work with the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern) at the [CERN](https://home.cern) Large Hadron Collider.
I was a LPC Distinguished Researcher for the 2022 and 2023 terms at the Fermi National Accelerator Lab [LHC Physics Center](https://lpc.fnal.gov).
My github username is inspired by Bart Simpson's alter-ego *El Barto*.

I like running or riding my bike around Boston, reading books and listening to good music.

## Research interests

My research is currently focussed on understanding the coupling of top quarks to the [SM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) [gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons).
You can find results of my previous work [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11270), and projections for future results in [this document](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04070).
A large part of my research work currently revolves around the development of a new part of the CMS detector [that can measure the arrival time of particles with a below 40ps time resolution.](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2667167).

During my [PhD thesis](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/2667) I focussed on searches for [supersymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry) particles like [gluinos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09814) or [top squarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10892).

## Projects

### Development of a precision particle timing detector

Upgrades to the Large Hadron Collider will increase the number of simultaneous proton collisions by a factor of 4.
This will help physicists record more interesting events to analyze, but will introduce challenges to disentangle collision vertices from different protons within the same bunch crossing.
While vertices will overlap in space too close to be distinguished using spatial information alone, the collisions are spread enough in time that a detector with 30ps time resolution will be able to separate them.
The initial design of such a new detector is described in the [CMS Technical Design Report No 20](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2667167).
I have worked on the design and layout of the detector that will be installed in the endcaps of the CMS experiment, and have developed front-end electronics, back-end firmware as well as control and analysis software together with engineers and students at Boston University.
A prototype detector has recently been successfully tested in an electron/positron beam at the [DESY II test beam facility](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09328) in Hamburg, Germany.
In the future, such detectors will enable full 4D tracking and will be paramount to experiments at upcoming particle collider experiments.

### Searches for Supersymmetry

Supersymmetry is one of the most appealing theories to solve several shortcomings of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM).
One of the main predictions is the introduction of partner particles to the SM particles, which differ in mass and spin, and are usually named simlar to SM particles with a -ino suffix or a s- prefix
I have worked on and lead searches for the production of [gluinos](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931830217X), [top squarks](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08701-5) and [electroweakinos](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2853345).
Innovative strategies and statistical combinations of these efforts have lead to some of the most stringent constraints on the tested models to date.
I have also developed a new algorithm to improve discrimination against transverse momentum imbalance from resolution effects, the [MET significance](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/14/07/P07004), based on bootstrap methods.
The traditional version of this algorithm has been used in [searches for top squarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10892).
Reinterpretations of the results also tightly constrain some models for Dark Matter production and the [invisible decays of Higgs bosons](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-11952-7).

### Measurements of top quark couplings

Couplings of the top quark to SM bosons are subject to corrections from massive particles beyond the SM, leading to subtle changes in the production rate and particle spectra of rare SM processes.
I have developed new analyses that measure the coupling of the top quark to the Z boson.
In a [first attempt to precisely measure spectra of the Z boson](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11270) we were able to confirm the SM predictions with unprecedented precision.
[A complementary method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03674) of confirming these measurements is currently in development.
Many theories, for example ones that include an extended Higgs sector, predict flavor-changing neutral currents which are highly suppressed in the SM.
[Results that we obtained](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2872677) set some of the most stringent limits on these models.

### Collimation System for a High-Power Proton-Synchrotron

High-intensity neutrino beams can be created by directing the proton beam from a high-power proton accelerator into a fixed target.
A new high-power proton-synchrotron has been studied at CERN, delivering a 2 MW beam that is steared using superconducting magnets.
Particle losses into the aperture of the accelerator have to be minimized to avoid quenching of the superconducting magnets.
Beam-halo particles therefore have to be cleaned away using a well crafted collimation system.
I have simulated and optimized the material, thickness and position of a [collimation system](https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/IPAC2014/papers/mopri109.pdf) that aims to achieve losses of less than 1 W/m. 

### Development of test benches and control valves

As a R&D engineer I have developed several new testing methods and designed test benches to characterize and improve quality control for high-precision control valves.
I have coordinated work with different companies to adopt servo drives as actuators for improved control precision and speed.
